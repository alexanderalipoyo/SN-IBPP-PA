In everything we do, we always put our partners first. That\\'s why we\\'re completely independently owned, white-label, channel-only, and don\\'t believe in annual contracts. Our Partner Subscription allows our partners to resell a variety of services that have been built to help you consolidate vendors, differentiate your business, add high-value to your offering, and mitigate the top risks your clients face in today\\'s threat landscape. So, how does it all work? We at Breach Secure Now focus on four main components of risks that when coupled with your Managed Services Offering, a robust layered security approach can be achieved. These four components are Human Security, Cybersecurity, Compliance, and Breach Response.Step 1: Partner SubscriptionYou\\'ve made the first step to combatting your clients\\' risks by becoming a Breach Secure Now Partner! Not only does this monthly Partner Subscription cost get you access to resell our white-label product line, but you also get:With just our Partner Subscription, you are able to leverage all of our sales and marketing content, like done-for-you landing pages, along with your unlimited baseline security assessments to grow your organization, increase your marketing efforts, and position yourself as a trusted adviser - all included. Now that you\\'ve got your Partner Subscription benefits down, it\\'s time to start reselling and rolling out your per-client services!Partner Subscription UpgradesOur Partner Subscription upgrades are services available for your internal MSP organization. These are not per-client upgrades and consist of two options: Dark Web MonitoringFor partners wishing to provide Dark Web Monitoring as a standalone service, you can add-on blocks of 10 domain licenses for an addition $110/mo per block. Note: Dark Web Monitoring is included in the Breach Prevention Platform (BPP), HIPAA BPP, and EVA MD services and are recommended for a layered security approach. Partner HIPAA Compliance ProgramThis $30/mo add-on is highly recommended for partners looking to resell our HIPAA Services product line as well as for Business Associates that need to comply with HIPAA regulations. You\\'ll get a one-on-one walk-through of your HIPAA Security Risk Assessment with our HIPAA experts with over 10 years of experience and a 100% OCR Audit Pass Rating!Step 2: Choose a Per-Client UpgradeWhile our Partner Subscription allows you to add unlimited client organizations to the PII Protect portal to run one-time dark web domain scans, one-time simulated phishing campaigns, and roll-out an annual security training course, our robust selection of per-client upgrades allow you to provide continuous and comprehensive services, with options to fit all your clients. Our per-client upgrades are an additional cost to your monthly subscription, with no published pricing you set your own profit margins. All clients with an active per-client upgrade subscription are eligible for cyber insurance. See our product comparison chart below to find which service is right for your client.Breach Prevention Platform (BPP)Our most comprehensive service, our Breach Prevention Platform (BPP), mitigates Human Security risks, identifies Cybersecurity risks, and meets Compliance requirements for State Data Security laws by aligning with a \"Reasonable Cybersecurity Program\" required by most states.This continuous security program is the all-in-one solution built to establish ongoing security practices for each of your client organizations and is powered by our Employee Vulnerability Assessment, EVA. Learn more about EVA here.HIPAA ServicesThe Department of Health and Human Services recommends healthcare organizations work with MSPs to meet their security needs, meaning there has never been a better time to leverage white-label HIPAA Compliance services to differentiate your organization! With three robust solutions, you can mitigate your client\\'s top security and compliance risks, today.Help your healthcare customers meet their annual minimum HIPAA compliance requirements. This is a standalone HIPAA compliance service and does not include any continuous training elements or cybersecurity services.Does your client handle compliance themselves or with another vendor? This robust healthcare cybersecurity solution identifies human security risks with EVA, and meets the annual HIPAA training requirement with our HIPAA Privacy & Security course. HIPAA compliance and cybersecurity go hand-in-hand. Help your healthcare customers go above and beyond the basic annual HIPAA compliance requirements with all the ongoing cybersecurity awareness training benefits you love in our Breach Prevention Platform.Outsourced HIPAA Help & Consultation ServicesIs your MSP uncomfortable handling HIPAA compliance but looking for a way to differentiate your MSP and add stickiness to your stack? Offer your healthcare customers required HIPAA compliance training, policy and procedure templates, and a robust HIPAA Risk Assessment - the perfect add-on to your Cybersecurity Awareness program! Outsource your HIPAA woes to the experts at HIPAA Secure Now, available as an add-on for all our HIPAA compliance services!Branding & Help Desk ServicesAdditional $30/monthRisk Assessment Consultation ServicesAdditional $55/monthEmployee Vulnerability Assessment (EVA)Subscriptions that leverage our Employee Vulnerability Assessment are the Breach Prevention Platform (BPP), HIPAA BPP, and EVA MD. EVA is our industry-first employee risk detection solution that analyzes security metrics on both the individual and organization level to identify and mitigate Human Security risks. Dark web data, simulated phishing fail rate, and security awareness training scores are the core metrics that make up an employee\\'s Employee Secure Score, or ESS. The ESS is like a FICO score, but for an employee\\'s security posture. Employees get access to a company-wide leaderboard adding friendly competition through screen names and gamification to increase engagement! For management, this leaderboard exposes employee names and reports on which employees are their weakest links, keeping security top of mind.Step 3: Add a Cyber Insurance Policy Effective January 1, 2022, cyber insurance will no longer be offered through the Breach Secure Now platform. Any clients with an active policy obtained through a Breach Secure Now partnership will not be renewed upon their annual renewal date.If you’re interested in exploring additional opportunities to secure cyber insurance for your MSP and your clients, we have partnered with Inskyber, an insurance brokerage that specializes in providing innovative solutions tailored to fit your needs.Security prospecting toolkitGetting your foot in the door with a prospect under MSP contract is no easy feat.

In everything we do, we always put our partners first. That\\'s why we\\'re completely independently owned, white-label, channel-only, and don\\'t believe in annual contracts. Our Partner Subscription allows our partners to resell a variety of services that have been built to help you consolidate vendors, differentiate your business, add high-value to your offering, and mitigate the top risks your clients face in today\\'s threat landscape. So, how does it all work? We at Breach Secure Now focus on four main components of risks that when coupled with your Managed Services Offering, a robust layered security approach can be achieved. These four components are Human Security, Cybersecurity, Compliance, and Breach Response.Step 1: Partner SubscriptionYou\\'ve made the first step to combatting your clients\\' risks by becoming a Breach Secure Now Partner! Not only does this monthly Partner Subscription cost get you access to resell our white-label product line, but you also get:With just our Partner Subscription, you are able to leverage all of our sales and marketing content, like done-for-you landing pages, along with your unlimited baseline security assessments to grow your organization, increase your marketing efforts, and position yourself as a trusted adviser - all included. Now that you\\'ve got your Partner Subscription benefits down, it\\'s time to start reselling and rolling out your per-client services!Partner Subscription UpgradesOur Partner Subscription upgrades are services available for your internal MSP organization. These are not per-client upgrades and consist of two options: Dark Web MonitoringFor partners wishing to provide Dark Web Monitoring as a standalone service, you can add-on blocks of 10 domain licenses for an addition $110/mo per block. Note: Dark Web Monitoring is included in the Breach Prevention Platform (BPP), HIPAA BPP, and EVA MD services and are recommended for a layered security approach. Partner HIPAA Compliance ProgramThis $30/mo add-on is highly recommended for partners looking to resell our HIPAA Services product line as well as for Business Associates that need to comply with HIPAA regulations. You\\'ll get a one-on-one walk-through of your HIPAA Security Risk Assessment with our HIPAA experts with over 10 years of experience and a 100% OCR Audit Pass Rating!Step 2: Choose a Per-Client UpgradeWhile our Partner Subscription allows you to add unlimited client organizations to the PII Protect portal to run one-time dark web domain scans, one-time simulated phishing campaigns, and roll-out an annual security training course, our robust selection of per-client upgrades allow you to provide continuous and comprehensive services, with options to fit all your clients. Our per-client upgrades are an additional cost to your monthly subscription, with no published pricing you set your own profit margins. All clients with an active per-client upgrade subscription are eligible for cyber insurance. See our product comparison chart below to find which service is right for your client.Breach Prevention Platform (BPP)Our most comprehensive service, our Breach Prevention Platform (BPP), mitigates Human Security risks, identifies Cybersecurity risks, and meets Compliance requirements for State Data Security laws by aligning with a \"Reasonable Cybersecurity Program\" required by most states.This continuous security program is the all-in-one solution built to establish ongoing security practices for each of your client organizations and is powered by our Employee Vulnerability Assessment, EVA. Learn more about EVA here.HIPAA ServicesThe Department of Health and Human Services recommends healthcare organizations work with MSPs to meet their security needs, meaning there has never been a better time to leverage white-label HIPAA Compliance services to differentiate your organization! With three robust solutions, you can mitigate your client\\'s top security and compliance risks, today.Help your healthcare customers meet their annual minimum HIPAA compliance requirements. This is a standalone HIPAA compliance service and does not include any continuous training elements or cybersecurity services.Does your client handle compliance themselves or with another vendor? This robust healthcare cybersecurity solution identifies human security risks with EVA, and meets the annual HIPAA training requirement with our HIPAA Privacy & Security course. HIPAA compliance and cybersecurity go hand-in-hand. Help your healthcare customers go above and beyond the basic annual HIPAA compliance requirements with all the ongoing cybersecurity awareness training benefits you love in our Breach Prevention Platform.Outsourced HIPAA Help & Consultation ServicesIs your MSP uncomfortable handling HIPAA compliance but looking for a way to differentiate your MSP and add stickiness to your stack? Offer your healthcare customers required HIPAA compliance training, policy and procedure templates, and a robust HIPAA Risk Assessment - the perfect add-on to your Cybersecurity Awareness program! Outsource your HIPAA woes to the experts at HIPAA Secure Now, available as an add-on for all our HIPAA compliance services!Branding & Help Desk ServicesAdditional $30/monthRisk Assessment Consultation ServicesAdditional $55/monthEmployee Vulnerability Assessment (EVA)Subscriptions that leverage our Employee Vulnerability Assessment are the Breach Prevention Platform (BPP), HIPAA BPP, and EVA MD. EVA is our industry-first employee risk detection solution that analyzes security metrics on both the individual and organization level to identify and mitigate Human Security risks. Dark web data, simulated phishing fail rate, and security awareness training scores are the core metrics that make up an employee\\'s Employee Secure Score, or ESS. The ESS is like a FICO score, but for an employee\\'s security posture. Employees get access to a company-wide leaderboard adding friendly competition through screen names and gamification to increase engagement! For management, this leaderboard exposes employee names and reports on which employees are their weakest links, keeping security top of mind.Step 3: Add a Cyber Insurance Policy Effective January 1, 2022, cyber insurance will no longer be offered through the Breach Secure Now platform. Any clients with an active policy obtained through a Breach Secure Now partnership will not be renewed upon their annual renewal date.If you’re interested in exploring additional opportunities to secure cyber insurance for your MSP and your clients, we have partnered with Inskyber, an insurance brokerage that specializes in providing innovative solutions tailored to fit your needs.Security prospecting toolkitGetting your foot in the door with a prospect under MSP contract is no easy feat.

In everything we do, we always put our partners first. That\\'s why we\\'re completely independently owned, white-label, channel-only, and don\\'t believe in annual contracts. Our Partner Subscription allows our partners to resell a variety of services that have been built to help you consolidate vendors, differentiate your business, add high-value to your offering, and mitigate the top risks your clients face in today\\'s threat landscape. So, how does it all work? We at Breach Secure Now focus on four main components of risks that when coupled with your Managed Services Offering, a robust layered security approach can be achieved. These four components are Human Security, Cybersecurity, Compliance, and Breach Response.Step 1: Partner SubscriptionYou\\'ve made the first step to combatting your clients\\' risks by becoming a Breach Secure Now Partner! Not only does this monthly Partner Subscription cost get you access to resell our white-label product line, but you also get:With just our Partner Subscription, you are able to leverage all of our sales and marketing content, like done-for-you landing pages, along with your unlimited baseline security assessments to grow your organization, increase your marketing efforts, and position yourself as a trusted adviser - all included. Now that you\\'ve got your Partner Subscription benefits down, it\\'s time to start reselling and rolling out your per-client services!Partner Subscription UpgradesOur Partner Subscription upgrades are services available for your internal MSP organization. These are not per-client upgrades and consist of two options: Dark Web MonitoringFor partners wishing to provide Dark Web Monitoring as a standalone service, you can add-on blocks of 10 domain licenses for an addition $110/mo per block. Note: Dark Web Monitoring is included in the Breach Prevention Platform (BPP), HIPAA BPP, and EVA MD services and are recommended for a layered security approach. Partner HIPAA Compliance ProgramThis $30/mo add-on is highly recommended for partners looking to resell our HIPAA Services product line as well as for Business Associates that need to comply with HIPAA regulations. You\\'ll get a one-on-one walk-through of your HIPAA Security Risk Assessment with our HIPAA experts with over 10 years of experience and a 100% OCR Audit Pass Rating!Step 2: Choose a Per-Client UpgradeWhile our Partner Subscription allows you to add unlimited client organizations to the PII Protect portal to run one-time dark web domain scans, one-time simulated phishing campaigns, and roll-out an annual security training course, our robust selection of per-client upgrades allow you to provide continuous and comprehensive services, with options to fit all your clients. Our per-client upgrades are an additional cost to your monthly subscription, with no published pricing you set your own profit margins. All clients with an active per-client upgrade subscription are eligible for cyber insurance. See our product comparison chart below to find which service is right for your client.Breach Prevention Platform (BPP)Our most comprehensive service, our Breach Prevention Platform (BPP), mitigates Human Security risks, identifies Cybersecurity risks, and meets Compliance requirements for State Data Security laws by aligning with a \"Reasonable Cybersecurity Program\" required by most states.This continuous security program is the all-in-one solution built to establish ongoing security practices for each of your client organizations and is powered by our Employee Vulnerability Assessment, EVA. Learn more about EVA here.HIPAA ServicesThe Department of Health and Human Services recommends healthcare organizations work with MSPs to meet their security needs, meaning there has never been a better time to leverage white-label HIPAA Compliance services to differentiate your organization! With three robust solutions, you can mitigate your client\\'s top security and compliance risks, today.Help your healthcare customers meet their annual minimum HIPAA compliance requirements. This is a standalone HIPAA compliance service and does not include any continuous training elements or cybersecurity services.Does your client handle compliance themselves or with another vendor? This robust healthcare cybersecurity solution identifies human security risks with EVA, and meets the annual HIPAA training requirement with our HIPAA Privacy & Security course. HIPAA compliance and cybersecurity go hand-in-hand. Help your healthcare customers go above and beyond the basic annual HIPAA compliance requirements with all the ongoing cybersecurity awareness training benefits you love in our Breach Prevention Platform.Outsourced HIPAA Help & Consultation ServicesIs your MSP uncomfortable handling HIPAA compliance but looking for a way to differentiate your MSP and add stickiness to your stack? Offer your healthcare customers required HIPAA compliance training, policy and procedure templates, and a robust HIPAA Risk Assessment - the perfect add-on to your Cybersecurity Awareness program! Outsource your HIPAA woes to the experts at HIPAA Secure Now, available as an add-on for all our HIPAA compliance services!Branding & Help Desk ServicesAdditional $30/monthRisk Assessment Consultation ServicesAdditional $55/monthEmployee Vulnerability Assessment (EVA)Subscriptions that leverage our Employee Vulnerability Assessment are the Breach Prevention Platform (BPP), HIPAA BPP, and EVA MD. EVA is our industry-first employee risk detection solution that analyzes security metrics on both the individual and organization level to identify and mitigate Human Security risks. Dark web data, simulated phishing fail rate, and security awareness training scores are the core metrics that make up an employee\\'s Employee Secure Score, or ESS. The ESS is like a FICO score, but for an employee\\'s security posture. Employees get access to a company-wide leaderboard adding friendly competition through screen names and gamification to increase engagement! For management, this leaderboard exposes employee names and reports on which employees are their weakest links, keeping security top of mind.Step 3: Add a Cyber Insurance Policy Effective January 1, 2022, cyber insurance will no longer be offered through the Breach Secure Now platform. Any clients with an active policy obtained through a Breach Secure Now partnership will not be renewed upon their annual renewal date.If you’re interested in exploring additional opportunities to secure cyber insurance for your MSP and your clients, we have partnered with Inskyber, an insurance brokerage that specializes in providing innovative solutions tailored to fit your needs.Security prospecting toolkitGetting your foot in the door with a prospect under MSP contract is no easy feat.

In everything we do, we always put our partners first. That\\'s why we\\'re completely independently owned, white-label, channel-only, and don\\'t believe in annual contracts. Our Partner Subscription allows our partners to resell a variety of services that have been built to help you consolidate vendors, differentiate your business, add high-value to your offering, and mitigate the top risks your clients face in today\\'s threat landscape. So, how does it all work? We at Breach Secure Now focus on four main components of risks that when coupled with your Managed Services Offering, a robust layered security approach can be achieved. These four components are Human Security, Cybersecurity, Compliance, and Breach Response.Step 1: Partner SubscriptionYou\\'ve made the first step to combatting your clients\\' risks by becoming a Breach Secure Now Partner! Not only does this monthly Partner Subscription cost get you access to resell our white-label product line, but you also get:With just our Partner Subscription, you are able to leverage all of our sales and marketing content, like done-for-you landing pages, along with your unlimited baseline security assessments to grow your organization, increase your marketing efforts, and position yourself as a trusted adviser - all included. Now that you\\'ve got your Partner Subscription benefits down, it\\'s time to start reselling and rolling out your per-client services!Partner Subscription UpgradesOur Partner Subscription upgrades are services available for your internal MSP organization. These are not per-client upgrades and consist of two options: Dark Web MonitoringFor partners wishing to provide Dark Web Monitoring as a standalone service, you can add-on blocks of 10 domain licenses for an addition $110/mo per block. Note: Dark Web Monitoring is included in the Breach Prevention Platform (BPP), HIPAA BPP, and EVA MD services and are recommended for a layered security approach. Partner HIPAA Compliance ProgramThis $30/mo add-on is highly recommended for partners looking to resell our HIPAA Services product line as well as for Business Associates that need to comply with HIPAA regulations. You\\'ll get a one-on-one walk-through of your HIPAA Security Risk Assessment with our HIPAA experts with over 10 years of experience and a 100% OCR Audit Pass Rating!Step 2: Choose a Per-Client UpgradeWhile our Partner Subscription allows you to add unlimited client organizations to the PII Protect portal to run one-time dark web domain scans, one-time simulated phishing campaigns, and roll-out an annual security training course, our robust selection of per-client upgrades allow you to provide continuous and comprehensive services, with options to fit all your clients. Our per-client upgrades are an additional cost to your monthly subscription, with no published pricing you set your own profit margins. All clients with an active per-client upgrade subscription are eligible for cyber insurance. See our product comparison chart below to find which service is right for your client.Breach Prevention Platform (BPP)Our most comprehensive service, our Breach Prevention Platform (BPP), mitigates Human Security risks, identifies Cybersecurity risks, and meets Compliance requirements for State Data Security laws by aligning with a \"Reasonable Cybersecurity Program\" required by most states.This continuous security program is the all-in-one solution built to establish ongoing security practices for each of your client organizations and is powered by our Employee Vulnerability Assessment, EVA. Learn more about EVA here.HIPAA ServicesThe Department of Health and Human Services recommends healthcare organizations work with MSPs to meet their security needs, meaning there has never been a better time to leverage white-label HIPAA Compliance services to differentiate your organization! With three robust solutions, you can mitigate your client\\'s top security and compliance risks, today.Help your healthcare customers meet their annual minimum HIPAA compliance requirements. This is a standalone HIPAA compliance service and does not include any continuous training elements or cybersecurity services.Does your client handle compliance themselves or with another vendor? This robust healthcare cybersecurity solution identifies human security risks with EVA, and meets the annual HIPAA training requirement with our HIPAA Privacy & Security course. HIPAA compliance and cybersecurity go hand-in-hand. Help your healthcare customers go above and beyond the basic annual HIPAA compliance requirements with all the ongoing cybersecurity awareness training benefits you love in our Breach Prevention Platform.Outsourced HIPAA Help & Consultation ServicesIs your MSP uncomfortable handling HIPAA compliance but looking for a way to differentiate your MSP and add stickiness to your stack? Offer your healthcare customers required HIPAA compliance training, policy and procedure templates, and a robust HIPAA Risk Assessment - the perfect add-on to your Cybersecurity Awareness program! Outsource your HIPAA woes to the experts at HIPAA Secure Now, available as an add-on for all our HIPAA compliance services!Branding & Help Desk ServicesAdditional $30/monthRisk Assessment Consultation ServicesAdditional $55/monthEmployee Vulnerability Assessment (EVA)Subscriptions that leverage our Employee Vulnerability Assessment are the Breach Prevention Platform (BPP), HIPAA BPP, and EVA MD. EVA is our industry-first employee risk detection solution that analyzes security metrics on both the individual and organization level to identify and mitigate Human Security risks. Dark web data, simulated phishing fail rate, and security awareness training scores are the core metrics that make up an employee\\'s Employee Secure Score, or ESS. The ESS is like a FICO score, but for an employee\\'s security posture. Employees get access to a company-wide leaderboard adding friendly competition through screen names and gamification to increase engagement! For management, this leaderboard exposes employee names and reports on which employees are their weakest links, keeping security top of mind.Step 3: Add a Cyber Insurance Policy Effective January 1, 2022, cyber insurance will no longer be offered through the Breach Secure Now platform. Any clients with an active policy obtained through a Breach Secure Now partnership will not be renewed upon their annual renewal date.If you’re interested in exploring additional opportunities to secure cyber insurance for your MSP and your clients, we have partnered with Inskyber, an insurance brokerage that specializes in providing innovative solutions tailored to fit your needs.Security prospecting toolkitGetting your foot in the door with a prospect under MSP contract is no easy feat.

In everything we do, we always put our partners first. That\\'s why we\\'re completely independently owned, white-label, channel-only, and don\\'t believe in annual contracts. Our Partner Subscription allows our partners to resell a variety of services that have been built to help you consolidate vendors, differentiate your business, add high-value to your offering, and mitigate the top risks your clients face in today\\'s threat landscape. So, how does it all work? We at Breach Secure Now focus on four main components of risks that when coupled with your Managed Services Offering, a robust layered security approach can be achieved. These four components are Human Security, Cybersecurity, Compliance, and Breach Response.Step 1: Partner SubscriptionYou\\'ve made the first step to combatting your clients\\' risks by becoming a Breach Secure Now Partner! Not only does this monthly Partner Subscription cost get you access to resell our white-label product line, but you also get:With just our Partner Subscription, you are able to leverage all of our sales and marketing content, like done-for-you landing pages, along with your unlimited baseline security assessments to grow your organization, increase your marketing efforts, and position yourself as a trusted adviser - all included. Now that you\\'ve got your Partner Subscription benefits down, it\\'s time to start reselling and rolling out your per-client services!Partner Subscription UpgradesOur Partner Subscription upgrades are services available for your internal MSP organization. These are not per-client upgrades and consist of two options: Dark Web MonitoringFor partners wishing to provide Dark Web Monitoring as a standalone service, you can add-on blocks of 10 domain licenses for an addition $110/mo per block. Note: Dark Web Monitoring is included in the Breach Prevention Platform (BPP), HIPAA BPP, and EVA MD services and are recommended for a layered security approach. Partner HIPAA Compliance ProgramThis $30/mo add-on is highly recommended for partners looking to resell our HIPAA Services product line as well as for Business Associates that need to comply with HIPAA regulations. You\\'ll get a one-on-one walk-through of your HIPAA Security Risk Assessment with our HIPAA experts with over 10 years of experience and a 100% OCR Audit Pass Rating!Step 2: Choose a Per-Client UpgradeWhile our Partner Subscription allows you to add unlimited client organizations to the PII Protect portal to run one-time dark web domain scans, one-time simulated phishing campaigns, and roll-out an annual security training course, our robust selection of per-client upgrades allow you to provide continuous and comprehensive services, with options to fit all your clients. Our per-client upgrades are an additional cost to your monthly subscription, with no published pricing you set your own profit margins. All clients with an active per-client upgrade subscription are eligible for cyber insurance. See our product comparison chart below to find which service is right for your client.Breach Prevention Platform (BPP)Our most comprehensive service, our Breach Prevention Platform (BPP), mitigates Human Security risks, identifies Cybersecurity risks, and meets Compliance requirements for State Data Security laws by aligning with a \"Reasonable Cybersecurity Program\" required by most states.This continuous security program is the all-in-one solution built to establish ongoing security practices for each of your client organizations and is powered by our Employee Vulnerability Assessment, EVA. Learn more about EVA here.HIPAA ServicesThe Department of Health and Human Services recommends healthcare organizations work with MSPs to meet their security needs, meaning there has never been a better time to leverage white-label HIPAA Compliance services to differentiate your organization! With three robust solutions, you can mitigate your client\\'s top security and compliance risks, today.Help your healthcare customers meet their annual minimum HIPAA compliance requirements. This is a standalone HIPAA compliance service and does not include any continuous training elements or cybersecurity services.Does your client handle compliance themselves or with another vendor? This robust healthcare cybersecurity solution identifies human security risks with EVA, and meets the annual HIPAA training requirement with our HIPAA Privacy & Security course. HIPAA compliance and cybersecurity go hand-in-hand. Help your healthcare customers go above and beyond the basic annual HIPAA compliance requirements with all the ongoing cybersecurity awareness training benefits you love in our Breach Prevention Platform.Outsourced HIPAA Help & Consultation ServicesIs your MSP uncomfortable handling HIPAA compliance but looking for a way to differentiate your MSP and add stickiness to your stack? Offer your healthcare customers required HIPAA compliance training, policy and procedure templates, and a robust HIPAA Risk Assessment - the perfect add-on to your Cybersecurity Awareness program! Outsource your HIPAA woes to the experts at HIPAA Secure Now, available as an add-on for all our HIPAA compliance services!Branding & Help Desk ServicesAdditional $30/monthRisk Assessment Consultation ServicesAdditional $55/monthEmployee Vulnerability Assessment (EVA)Subscriptions that leverage our Employee Vulnerability Assessment are the Breach Prevention Platform (BPP), HIPAA BPP, and EVA MD. EVA is our industry-first employee risk detection solution that analyzes security metrics on both the individual and organization level to identify and mitigate Human Security risks. Dark web data, simulated phishing fail rate, and security awareness training scores are the core metrics that make up an employee\\'s Employee Secure Score, or ESS. The ESS is like a FICO score, but for an employee\\'s security posture. Employees get access to a company-wide leaderboard adding friendly competition through screen names and gamification to increase engagement! For management, this leaderboard exposes employee names and reports on which employees are their weakest links, keeping security top of mind.Step 3: Add a Cyber Insurance Policy Effective January 1, 2022, cyber insurance will no longer be offered through the Breach Secure Now platform. Any clients with an active policy obtained through a Breach Secure Now partnership will not be renewed upon their annual renewal date.If you’re interested in exploring additional opportunities to secure cyber insurance for your MSP and your clients, we have partnered with Inskyber, an insurance brokerage that specializes in providing innovative solutions tailored to fit your needs.Security prospecting toolkitGetting your foot in the door with a prospect under MSP contract is no easy feat.

In everything we do, we always put our partners first. That\\'s why we\\'re completely independently owned, white-label, channel-only, and don\\'t believe in annual contracts. Our Partner Subscription allows our partners to resell a variety of services that have been built to help you consolidate vendors, differentiate your business, add high-value to your offering, and mitigate the top risks your clients face in today\\'s threat landscape. So, how does it all work? We at Breach Secure Now focus on four main components of risks that when coupled with your Managed Services Offering, a robust layered security approach can be achieved. These four components are Human Security, Cybersecurity, Compliance, and Breach Response.Step 1: Partner SubscriptionYou\\'ve made the first step to combatting your clients\\' risks by becoming a Breach Secure Now Partner! Not only does this monthly Partner Subscription cost get you access to resell our white-label product line, but you also get:With just our Partner Subscription, you are able to leverage all of our sales and marketing content, like done-for-you landing pages, along with your unlimited baseline security assessments to grow your organization, increase your marketing efforts, and position yourself as a trusted adviser - all included. Now that you\\'ve got your Partner Subscription benefits down, it\\'s time to start reselling and rolling out your per-client services!Partner Subscription UpgradesOur Partner Subscription upgrades are services available for your internal MSP organization. These are not per-client upgrades and consist of two options: Dark Web MonitoringFor partners wishing to provide Dark Web Monitoring as a standalone service, you can add-on blocks of 10 domain licenses for an addition $110/mo per block. Note: Dark Web Monitoring is included in the Breach Prevention Platform (BPP), HIPAA BPP, and EVA MD services and are recommended for a layered security approach. Partner HIPAA Compliance ProgramThis $30/mo add-on is highly recommended for partners looking to resell our HIPAA Services product line as well as for Business Associates that need to comply with HIPAA regulations. You\\'ll get a one-on-one walk-through of your HIPAA Security Risk Assessment with our HIPAA experts with over 10 years of experience and a 100% OCR Audit Pass Rating!Step 2: Choose a Per-Client UpgradeWhile our Partner Subscription allows you to add unlimited client organizations to the PII Protect portal to run one-time dark web domain scans, one-time simulated phishing campaigns, and roll-out an annual security training course, our robust selection of per-client upgrades allow you to provide continuous and comprehensive services, with options to fit all your clients. Our per-client upgrades are an additional cost to your monthly subscription, with no published pricing you set your own profit margins. All clients with an active per-client upgrade subscription are eligible for cyber insurance. See our product comparison chart below to find which service is right for your client.Breach Prevention Platform (BPP)Our most comprehensive service, our Breach Prevention Platform (BPP), mitigates Human Security risks, identifies Cybersecurity risks, and meets Compliance requirements for State Data Security laws by aligning with a \"Reasonable Cybersecurity Program\" required by most states.This continuous security program is the all-in-one solution built to establish ongoing security practices for each of your client organizations and is powered by our Employee Vulnerability Assessment, EVA. Learn more about EVA here.HIPAA ServicesThe Department of Health and Human Services recommends healthcare organizations work with MSPs to meet their security needs, meaning there has never been a better time to leverage white-label HIPAA Compliance services to differentiate your organization! With three robust solutions, you can mitigate your client\\'s top security and compliance risks, today.Help your healthcare customers meet their annual minimum HIPAA compliance requirements. This is a standalone HIPAA compliance service and does not include any continuous training elements or cybersecurity services.Does your client handle compliance themselves or with another vendor? This robust healthcare cybersecurity solution identifies human security risks with EVA, and meets the annual HIPAA training requirement with our HIPAA Privacy & Security course. HIPAA compliance and cybersecurity go hand-in-hand. Help your healthcare customers go above and beyond the basic annual HIPAA compliance requirements with all the ongoing cybersecurity awareness training benefits you love in our Breach Prevention Platform.Outsourced HIPAA Help & Consultation ServicesIs your MSP uncomfortable handling HIPAA compliance but looking for a way to differentiate your MSP and add stickiness to your stack? Offer your healthcare customers required HIPAA compliance training, policy and procedure templates, and a robust HIPAA Risk Assessment - the perfect add-on to your Cybersecurity Awareness program! Outsource your HIPAA woes to the experts at HIPAA Secure Now, available as an add-on for all our HIPAA compliance services!Branding & Help Desk ServicesAdditional $30/monthRisk Assessment Consultation ServicesAdditional $55/monthEmployee Vulnerability Assessment (EVA)Subscriptions that leverage our Employee Vulnerability Assessment are the Breach Prevention Platform (BPP), HIPAA BPP, and EVA MD. EVA is our industry-first employee risk detection solution that analyzes security metrics on both the individual and organization level to identify and mitigate Human Security risks. Dark web data, simulated phishing fail rate, and security awareness training scores are the core metrics that make up an employee\\'s Employee Secure Score, or ESS. The ESS is like a FICO score, but for an employee\\'s security posture. Employees get access to a company-wide leaderboard adding friendly competition through screen names and gamification to increase engagement! For management, this leaderboard exposes employee names and reports on which employees are their weakest links, keeping security top of mind.Step 3: Add a Cyber Insurance Policy Effective January 1, 2022, cyber insurance will no longer be offered through the Breach Secure Now platform. Any clients with an active policy obtained through a Breach Secure Now partnership will not be renewed upon their annual renewal date.If you’re interested in exploring additional opportunities to secure cyber insurance for your MSP and your clients, we have partnered with Inskyber, an insurance brokerage that specializes in providing innovative solutions tailored to fit your needs.Security prospecting toolkitGetting your foot in the door with a prospect under MSP contract is no easy feat.
